## Introduction

This repository houses the Java code that powers our robot for the FRC competition. The code is organized using the WPILib library, which provides a framework for FRC robot development. Feel free to explore the codebase, learn from it, and contribute to its improvement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [FRC VS Code](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/frc1937/Crescendo2024.git
    ```

2. Open the project in FRC VS Code.

3. Deploy the code to your robot and start testing!

## Code Structure

Our codebase is organized as follows:

- **src/main/java/frc/robot**: Contains the main robot code.
- **src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems**: Subsystem classes for different robot components.
- **src/main/java/frc/robot/commands**: Command classes that define specific robot actions.
- **src/main/java/frc/robot/utils**: Utility classes and helper functions.
- **src/main/java/frc/robot/RobotContainer.java**: Main entry point for the robot code.

Feel free to explore these directories and files to understand how our robot code is structured.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from our team members. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Thank you for your interest and support! Let's make this robot season a success!
